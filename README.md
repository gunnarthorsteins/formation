# formation

This repo contains a reproduction of the results of "Predicting the impact of formation protocols on battery lifetime immediately after manufacturing". It was written as part of Voltaiq's VCE Fellowship.

`reproduction.ipynb` contains the actual implementation, with `utils.py` and `figures.py` acting as back-up vocals.
